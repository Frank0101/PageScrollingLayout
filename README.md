This is a Page Scrolling Layout with a fixed navigation menu.

The layout allow to have a header, a footer and several pages with a responsive behavior.
Pages can contain scrollable content (as showed in PageScrolling2.html and PageScrolling3.html demo pages).

A Javascript API allow to communicate with the layout to send commands (such as changing the current page or
showing/hiding the header or the footer) and to be notified about changes in the layout status (such as
when the current page changes).

Dependencies:
- jQuery
- Modernizr
